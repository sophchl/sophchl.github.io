Hey, I am Sophia, a Statistician/Data Scientist with a background in Mathematical Finance, curious about scrutinizing data to get a different perspective on real-world problems.

I started this blog when a broken foot forced me to take a break from the outdoors. It is intended as a platform for sharing some of my writing and data works from everyday topics such as climbing, exercise, co2-consumption, and others - hopefully. If you have any comments, feedback, ideas, or issues, please drop a message!

My work and thinking is focused on the goal of contributing to a society that uses its ressources responsibly. Inspired by the research from 80,000 hours, I hope to think that while there many pressing problems in the world, there is a way we can make a difference. Be it Climate Change, Global health, Power-seeking AI systems, Engineered pandemics or others. For more information, please check out [the 80,000 hour problem profiles](https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/).
