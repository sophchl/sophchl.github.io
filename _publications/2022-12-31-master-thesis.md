**Do investors actually care about climate change regulation?** Instead of asking them directly, this work looks at how much investors are willing to pay to protect themselves against climate policy risk. For that we study options written on S&P 500 stocks. Options are financial contracts that allow investors to lock in prices in the future. Roughly speaking, stock prices reflect investors’ aggregate assessment of a firm’s value, while option prices contain additional information about perceived risk and uncertainty.

The main challenge is to isolate the part of price movements that is related specifically to climate regulation, such as carbon taxes. Particularly, as not all firms yet report their emissions. To account for the possibly non-random selection bias, the analysis uses a two-step estimation that involves the probability of reporting emissions. To measure different types of risk a stochastic-volatility–based option pricing framework is employed, that captures not only overall uncertainty, but also the risk of extreme losses and sudden price jumps. Comparing these risk measures across firms with different carbon footprints reveals a clear pattern.

The key finding is that protection against sharp downside risks is significantly more expensive for firms with high carbon intensity and for firms that do not report their emissions. In addition, option-based insurance becomes more costly when attention to carbon taxation rises (measured with Google search activity). Taken together, the results show that **climate transition risk is at least partly priced into financial markets**.

In a sense, this is a reassuring result: **when climate transition risk is already priced into markets, potential shocks are partly absorbed in advance**, reducing the likelihood that sudden policy changes trigger a broader financial crisis. However, the transmission of such shocks and the dynamics of financial crises are beyond the scope of this study and remain topics for future research.
