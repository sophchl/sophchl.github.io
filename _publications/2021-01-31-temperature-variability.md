Why was the European summer of 2003 so extreme - and what does it tell us about climate change? Schär et al. (2004) show that the 2003 heatwave cannot be explained by a simple shift toward higher average temperatures alone.

The paper combines Swiss temperature observational data with regional climate model simulations based on IPCC emissions scenarios. The key insight is that **climate change does not just raise average temperatures, but also increases temperature variability**. Under this framework, a summer like 2003 is no longer an outlier, but a plausible outcome.

The broader message is clear and unsettling: focusing on averages alone understates climate risk. Changes in the mean and in variability are not the same: while higher averages shift temperatures upward, **higher variance creates more frequent extremes on both ends**. For society and the economy, it is these extremes, not the average, that matter most. Adaptation must prepare for a more volatile climate, not just a warmer one.
