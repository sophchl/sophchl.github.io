This report looks at **how climate policy can create real financial risks**. This is especially for investors exposed to fossil fuels—by focusing on transition risk, the uncertainty and potential losses that arise as economies move from “brown” to “green.” Using climate policy scenarios from integrated assessment models, the paper runs a simplified stress test on an energy-sector bond portfolio and shows that stricter climate policies could significantly reduce bond values, with losses of up to around 16\% in some scenarios. The core idea is that lower future emissions imply lower energy production and revenues, which increases perceived default risk and pushes bond prices down. While the analysis is explicitly a “what if” exercise with strong assumptions and data limitations, it illustrates an important point: If the low-carbon transition is disorderly or sudden, financial losses could be large and systemic. The takeaway is that **climate transition risk is not abstract—it is something investors, firms, and regulators need to actively measure and manage**.
