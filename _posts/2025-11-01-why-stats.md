"We are imperfect creatures living in an uncertain world" writes Nate Silvers in his bestselling book *The Signal and the Noise*. 

This sentence, to me, captures well how scary or impossible trying to gain knowledge from the vast amount of information sometimes feels. To face the millions of news being published already daily[^1] we seem but poorly equipped with brains that excel at associative thinking, storytelling, and pattern recognition, but that struggle with statistical reasoning.[^2]

Knowing that statistics exists, often helps me not to lose my head in the face of complexity. It offers a way to engage with uncertainty without denying it, and even to see it as a chance.

Many questions that matter—scientifically, politically, or personally—are statistical at their core. How effective is a new drug? Which genotypes are most resistant to variable weather conditions? Which health insurance premium should I choose?

At this point, a common objection arises: “But can we trust statistics?” We have probably all heared someone say “Do not trust any statistics you did not fake yourself”.[^3] Or you might have heared about the replication crisis, when particularly in medicide researchers started to systematically realize, that a large share of published medical findings could not be independently reproduced.[^4] This skepticism is also reflected in the fact that for a long time one of the most famous books about statistics was *How to Lie with Statistics* by Darrell Huff. Huff documented many ways in which statistics can be manipulated: misleading averages, small samples, cherry-picked data, and distorted visualizations. The book sold millions of copies worldwide and shaped public perception of statistics for decades.

However, my reading of Huff’s message is not that statistics should be rejected altogether, but that it should be handled with care, both when producing it and when consuming it, much like any other form of information. Ironically, it seems like Huff fell victim to the fallacies he wrote about. Closely aligned with the tobacco industry, he started to argue statistically against the idea that smoking caused lung cancer.[^5] Still, nowadays accumulation of statistical evidence makes the relation between smoking and lung cancer barely contested. So - score for statistics, no?

There are many other examples, where statistics helped to get a scientific consensus view or good example to gain knowlegde. A short personal hall of fame

1. **Climate Change detection and attribution**  (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change): Statistical analysis of long-term climate observations and model simulations has shown that recent global warming cannot be explained by natural variability alone and is primarily driven by human activity.
2. **Epidemological monitoring** of e.g. COVID-19: Statistical surveillance of infections, hospitalizations, excess mortality, and mobility data made it possible to track the spread of the virus in real time and to evaluate the effects of interventions.
3. The whole work of <a href="https://ourworldindata.org" target="_blank">**ourworldindata**<\a>: Collecting and visuualising open-source data across domains as health, poverty, education and climate helps to gain a a coherent yet digestable picture of global development.
4. Identifying **smoking as a cause of cancer**: As mentioned above, consistent statistical evidence from multiple study designs established a causal relationship between smoking and lung cancer, despite controversy and organized counter-claims.

So let us not avoid statistics, but try to be as meticulous as possible. Yes - *It is easy to lie with statistics, but it is easier to lie without them.*[^6]
