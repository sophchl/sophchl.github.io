Hey, I am Sophia, a MSc Quantitative Finance graduate living in Switzerland, and really curious about scrutinizing data to get a different perspective on real-world problems.
I started this blog project when a broken foot forced me to take a break from the outdoors. It is intended as a platform for sharing some of my writing and data works from everyday topics such as climbing, exercise, co2-consumption, and others - hopefully. If you have any comments, feedback, ideas, or issues, please drop a message!

The blog is hosted on github (<a href="https://github.com/sophchl/sophchl.github.io" target="_blank">source code</a>), using the Jekyll theme Chirpy (which can be found <a href="https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy" target="_blank">here</a>).
